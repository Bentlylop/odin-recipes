        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic <br>
                in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cooking <br>
                and stirring until meat is cooked through, 10 to 15 <br>
                minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, <br>
                crushed tomatoes, Italian-style crushed tomatoes, <br>
                tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, <br>
                salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, fennel seeds, and <br>
                1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into meat mixture. Bring to a <br>
                boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer sauce for at least 1 <br>
                hour (up to 6 for best flavor). Stir occasionally.
            </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and <br>
                cover with very hot tap water; let soak for 30 minutes.
            </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons <br>
                parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg into egg until <br>
                thoroughly combined.
            </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
                Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce.<br>
                Layer 4 soaked lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese <br>
                mixture, 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4<br>
                cup Parmesan cheese in the dish. Repeat layers twice <br>
                more, ending with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. <br>
                Cover dish with aluminum foil.
            </p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
                Bake until lasagna noodles are tender and casserole is bubbling, about 45 <br>
                minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese topping is lightly browned, 10 to 15 <br>
                more minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
